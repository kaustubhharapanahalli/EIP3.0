This repository contains code of the assignments given at the External Internship Program which is conducted by Inkers.ai 
The program includes multiple phases. Currently, the repository contains the code of the assignments given in 1st Phase. The first three assignments focused on using the Optical Charater Recognition dataset from MNIST. 

The first assignment was to understand how CNNs work and understanding what is receptive field, Max Pooling and few basic content on using CNNs. The second assignment focused on helping us understand what is Back Propagation and how it works. The third assignment focused majorly on understanding the different types of Convolutional Neural Networks and how to use them to reduce the number of parameters in the architecture of a model. Also I understood how YOLO works. In the fourth assignment, we used the resnet architecture to train a model which gave 45%+ validation accuracy on the Tiny ImageNet Dataset [TinyImagenet Dataset](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip)
